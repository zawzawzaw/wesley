Results

The way the listings are displayed need to be altered - presently the premium listings and free listings are displayed on separate boxes each with their own page count. The premium listings should be displayed alongside the free listings on the same list, however they should appear first. i.e if there are 100 listings with 50 listings each, and 10 listings per page, then the premium listings shall take up the first 5 pages. Also besides a slightly different background, I would like for the same level of information to appear for all listings. (Basically what is already present in the premium listing). - done

=============



1. Listing structure needs to be split up in to several more pages with the following structure: General Info / Mandatory Info / Optional Info / Private Info with the option of skipping the last entire page. A progress bar should also be added to the top so the user knows how much more they have to go. (Also I've highlighted Green for large input boxes / Blue for single line). User should not be able to proceed to next page without filling in all complusory info

General Info: Company Name / Category (rename to Industry) / Sub-category (rename to Sector) / Address 1 / Address 2 / Post Code / City / State Province / Country (rename to Location) / Country of Origin

Mandatory Info: Nature of Business / Year Established / Company Background and Information / No. of Employees / Quality Certification 

Optional Info: Bankers / Main Shareholders or Parent Company / Market/s Established / Market/s Interested /  Number of Offices world wide / Links to related Companies / Upload Video / Upload Catalogue

Private Info: Major Facilities / Major Customers / Project History / Paid Up Capital 

2. Search results listings

There needs to be a way of sorting the results via: Name (A-Z) / Name (Z-A) / Proximity
