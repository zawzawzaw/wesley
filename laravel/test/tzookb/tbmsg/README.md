PHP multi user multi conversations messaging system, just like facebook :)

** just wanted to thank everyone for the feedback, and great bugs!
I'm still working hard to improve it, and I wanted to invite you all to the website that is the reason for me to create this package, and of course you could test it there:  http://bloompy.co

Currently hapening:

Description:
----------------

I decided to create this package because of the lack of real good messaging systems in php with the proper features like, deleting archiving messages for each specific user, multipile users in conversations and more.
I am trying to build this in a very generic way so it could be easilly implemented for each framework or project. Currently I'll try to build with laravel and eloquent as this is the project I'm currently building.
